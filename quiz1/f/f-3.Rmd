F1. Fitting a linear model by least squares.
```{r}
library(faraway)
data("sat")
head(sat)
```
Which of the following would produce the design matrix $\mathbb{X}$ for the model `lm(sat ~ ratio + expend, data = sat)`.

(a) `X <- matrix(rep(1, length(ratio)), ratio, expend)`
(a) `X <- matrix(1, ratio, expend)`
(a) `X <- cbind(rep(1, length(ratio)), ratio, expend)`
(a) `X <- cbind(1, ratio, expend)`
(a) `X <- cbind(ratio, expend)`

F2. Consider our kicker data from homework 3.

```{r}
data_nfl <- read.csv("FieldGoals2003to2006.csv",header = TRUE,skip=5)
head(data_nfl)
```

Recall that we built the model $y_i=mx_i+c_1z_{i,1}+c_2z_{i,2}+ \dots + c_{19}z_{i,19}+e_i$ where where $x_i$ is FGtM1 and $z_{i,1}$ takes the value 1 when row i of the data corresponds to kicker 1 (i.e., for i=1,2,3,4) and 0 otherwise. Write the design matrix of the model. (You do not need to include specific values for $x_i$.)
