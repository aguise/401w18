Suppose we define an R vector by `y <- c(3,NA,-1,4,NA,-2)`. What will `y[y>0]` give you?

(a). A vector of the positive elements and NA values of `y`.

(b). A vector of the negative elements of `y`.

(c). A vector of all `NA`s.

(d). A vector of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s.

(e). A vector of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s and `NA`s.
