Consider the following fitted linear model for ...
```{r lm_example}
# lm1 <- lm()
# summary(lm1)$coef
```
We write the sample linear model as $\vect{y}=\mat{X}\vect{b}+\vect{e}$ where $\mat{X}$ is ... [I'M THINKING THERE WON'T BE TIME FOR WRITING OUT MANY MODELS. WE'LL HAVE THEM WRITE OUT THE PROBABILITY MODEL IN THE F-TEST QUESTION AND GIVE THEM THE MODEL WHEN NEEDED ELSEWHERE]

Suppose we're interested in predicting the value of a new observation at [explanatory variable values] together with a measure of our prediction uncertainty.

(a) Specify the values in a row matrix $\vect{x}^*$ so that $\vect{y}^*=\vect{x}^*\vect{b}$ gives a least squares prediction of the new observation.

(b) Give a matrix
