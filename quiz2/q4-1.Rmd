The following is an ANOVA analysis of the football field goal kicking data that we have seen repeatedly.
Recall that `Name` is the name of the kicker, `FGt` is the field goal percentage for the kicker in that year, and `FGtM1` is the percentage for that kicker in the previous year.
```{r read_data}
kickers <- read.table("FieldGoals2003to2006.csv",header=T,sep=",")
kickers[1:5,c("Name","Teamt","FGt","FGtM1")]
lm_kickers <- lm(FGt~FGtM1+Name,data=kickers)
anova(lm_kickers)
```
(a) Write out the null and alternative hypotheses corresponding to the hypothesis test constructed in the `Name` row of the ANOVA table.

(b) Describe how this test is constructed.

(c) Interpret the outcome of this test.
