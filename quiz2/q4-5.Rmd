Recall the nels88 dataset from Q2. 
In this, they examined a subset of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 which examined schoolchildrenâ€™s performance on a math test score in 8th grade. "race" determines the race of each student which is one of White, Black, Asian or Hispanic.

```{r lm_example}
library(faraway)
data(nels88)
fit <- lm(math ~ ses + paredu + race, data = nels88)
summary(fit)
anova(fit)
```
Suppose we are interested in finding whether the race of the student affects their performance.
(a)  Write out the null and alternative hypothesis for carrying out the above analysis. (Describe all parameters clearly)

(b) Which test would you carry out? Clearly explains the steps (give relevant formulae).

(c) Report your conclusion.
